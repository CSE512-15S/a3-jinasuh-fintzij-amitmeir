## 2014 Ebola Outbreak in West Africa

This is an example repository for your assignment 3 submission. 
(Put your a brief description of your final interactive visualization application and your dataset here.)


## Running Instructions

Put your running instructions here. (Tell us how to run your visualization.) 

If your visualization is web-based,  it would be great if your submission can be opened online. [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) is a good and easy way to put your visualization online so you can put your link here.  For example:

Access our visualization at http://cse512-15s.github.io/a3-jheer-domoritz-jasnyder/ or download this repository and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000` and access this from http://localhost:9000/.

If you put your work online, please also write a [one-line description and add a link to your final work](http://note.io/1n3u46s) so people can access it directly from the CSE512-15S page.

## Story Board

Put either your storyboard content or a [link to your storyboard pdf file](storyboard.pdf?raw=true) here. Just like A2, you can use any software to create a *reasonable* pdf storyboard.
